## Usage

After installation, the extension will automatically start working on YouTube. You can control its functionality using the popup which provides:

- A toggle switch to enable or disable the extension.
- A display showing the total number of ads skipped.
- A display showing the total time saved by skipping ads.

## Epilepsy Warning

This extension works by detecting if an ad is playing, skipping to the end, and clicking the skip button. Due to this method, the screen may flicker or flash when an ad is being skipped, which could potentially trigger photosensitive epilepsy. Please use with caution.
